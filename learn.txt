You’re getting **two issues**:

1. **PushRejected → non-fast-forward**
2. **git pull → refusing to merge unrelated histories**

This happens when **your local repo and the remote repo were created separately**, so Git thinks they have **different histories**.

Here are the **clean solutions**, pick the one you want ⬇️

---

# ✅ **SOLUTION 1: Pull with unrelated histories (safe, recommended)**

Run this:

```
git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories
```

Git will ask you to resolve merge conflicts (if any).
After resolving and committing:

```
git push origin main
```

Done.

---

# ✅ **SOLUTION 2: Force push your local version (remote will be overwritten)**

⚠️ *This deletes whatever is on GitHub main branch.*

Use only if you want to override GitHub.

```
git push origin main --force
```

---

# ❗ Why did this happen?

* You **created a repo locally**, then
* You **created a GitHub repo with README or license**,
* Both have different commit histories → Git refuses to merge.

---

# ⭐ Recommended for you (quick + safe)

Run this:

```
git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories
git add .
git commit -m "merge remote and local"
git push origin main
```
